# Constrained Manipulability
Constrained Manipulability is a library used to compute and vizualize a robot's constrained capacities. 

## Features
 - Compute a robot's constrained allowable Cartesian motions due to collision avoidance constraints and joint limits
 - Compute a robot's constrained manipulability polytope due to dangerfield constraints
 - Static functions that allow the above quantities to be used in optimization algorithms for collision free trajectory optimization

## Installation 
### Dependencies

### Mesh Tools
If on the `mesh_tools` branch for a fancy RViz plugin to visualise the polytope meshes, then you will also need in your workspace:
- [mesh_tools](https://github.com/uos/mesh_tools/tree/1.0.1) -- Note specifically tag v1.0.1

The RViz .config files have been modified to include these fancy polytope visualisation topics.

### Install instructions
Clone repo into your current workspace as follows:
```
cd catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/philip-long/constrained_manipulability.git
cd ..
catkin build
```

### Examples
Demos can be launched for a robot, using the provided test file:
```
roslaunch constrained_manipulability abstract_robot.launch root_link:=<your root link> root_link:=<your end effector>  config:=<your scene stored in .yaml>
```
There are several example scenes in scene_config folder, which have been tested for the Universal Robot (requires ur-description) and Kinova Gen3 (requires kortex_description) arms. Please launch for reference:
```
 roslaunch constrained_manipulability abstract_ur3e.launch
 roslaunch constrained_manipulability abstract_gen3.launch
```

## Launching Shrinking (changing linearization limit) Polytope Test
```
 roslaunch constrained_manipulability shrinking_polytope_test.launch
 rosrun constrained_manipulability lin_limit_pub.py 
```

## Launching Octomap Test
```
roslaunch constrained_manipulability octomap_test.launch
```

## Launching IK Teleoperation Test
First launch the octomap and the polytope server:
```
roslaunch constrained_manipulability cm_server_test.launch
```
Then launch the sample IK file. This calls the polytope server then uses the convex constraints in an optimization routine use sim parameter for visualization only or else pass the robot's joint states:
```
rosrun constrained_manipulability cm_client.py _joint_state:=robot_joint_state
```
```
rosrun constrained_manipulability cm_client.py _sim:=true
```

We use [cvxpy](https://www.cvxpy.org/) (pip install cvxpy) as the solver cost function:
```
cost=cp.sum_squares(jacobian@dq - dx)
```
subject to 
```
A@dq<= b
```
where dx is a desired change in position for instance and input twist. the input twist can be generated by a teleop command
```
rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py _speed:=0.03 _turn:=0.014
```

## Computation:
The polytopes are calculated by obtaining the minimum distance from each link on the robot to objects in the collision world. FCL is used to compute these distance and access via the interface package [robot_collision_checking]((https://github.com/philip-long/ros_collision_checking)). The volume of the polytopes in _Cartesian_ space is return from the get functions as follows:

```
    double getConstrainedAllowableMotionPolytope ( const sensor_msgs::JointState & joint_states,
            Eigen::MatrixXd & AHrep,
            Eigen::VectorXd & bhrep,
            bool show_polytope,
            std::vector<double>  color_pts= {0.0,0.0,0.5,1.0},
            std::vector<double>  color_line= {0.0,0.0,1.0,0.8} );
```
AHrep and bhrep represent the joint space polytope constraints i.e.
```
AHrep*dq <= bhrep
```
conversion from H-representation to V-representation is achieved using the Double Description method accessed via [eigen-cddlib]((https://github.com/philip-long/eigen-cddlib)). Static functions are also available for all the different polytopes where, both the urdf model, the KDL chain and the object set must be explicity passed:
```
    static double getConstrainedAllowableMotionPolytope ( KDL::Chain &  chain,
            urdf::Model & model,
            FCLObjectSet objects,
            const sensor_msgs::JointState & joint_states,
            Eigen::MatrixXd & AHrep,
            Eigen::VectorXd & bhrep,
            double linearization_limit=0.1,
            double distance_threshold=0.3 );
```

Different Polytopes are available more information about allowable motion polytope is available here __Optimization-Based Human-in-the-Loop Manipulation  Using Joint Space Polytopes, Long et al 2019__ more information about the constrained velocity polytope is available here __Evaluating Robot Manipulability in Constrained Environments by Velocity Polytope Reduction Long et al 2018.__ 


## Usage:
The main object is initialized as follows:
```
    ConstrainedManipulability ( ros::NodeHandle nh,
                                std::string root,
                                std::string tip,
				std::string robot_description="robot_description",
                                double distance_threshold=0.3,
                                double linearization_limit=0.1,
                                double dangerfield=10
                              );
```

It reads a kinematic chain from the parameter server starting a the root and running until the tip. The joint position and velocity limits are also read and are used to define the different polytopes. The collision model of the report is also pared. A collision world is maintained, objects can be added using ros_shape_msgs and Eigen::Affine3d

```
bool addCollisionObject ( const shape_msgs::SolidPrimitive & s1,
                              const  Eigen::Affine3d  & wT1,unsigned int object_id );
bool addCollisionObject ( const shape_msgs::Mesh & s1,
                              const  Eigen::Affine3d  & wT1,unsigned int object_id );
```
Objects are removed by id.
```
bool removeCollisionObject (unsigned int object_id );
```
#### Octomaps
Octomaps can now be used to as objects, the class subcribes to the _"constrained_manipulability/octomap_full"_ topic

## Applications:
A video showing the applications of the constrained allowable motion polytope is available [here](https://youtu.be/oeqj-m25t9c). A video showing the uses of the constrained velocity polytope for humanoid robots can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Nouc4f_rIY) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzlhsLH5IPU).


#### 1. Motion planning
Planning collision free paths can be achieved by maximizing the volume of the allowable motion polytope, however since no analytical gradient is available this is typically slower than other motion planning algorithms. Nevertheless, since the polytopes are returned they can be used for fast on-line inverse kinematic solutions and guard teleoperation. 

![Planning collision free path by maximizing volume](doc/trajplanning.png)

#### 2. Guarded teleoperation
The polytopes are convex constraints that represent feasible configuration for the whole robot. By respecting them a guaranteed feasible inverse kinematic solution can be obtained very quickly, this can be useful for generating virtual fixtures for teleoperation tasks. The polytope can be vizualized (in red below) showing an operator the Cartesian motions available at all times due to joint limits, kinematic constraints and obstacles in the workspace. The original polytope is shown below in blue/

#### 3. Workspace Analysis
By evaluating the volume of the CMP at points in the workspace, a reachability map can be obtained see this [video](https://youtu.be/jc7X4WakdoE)
